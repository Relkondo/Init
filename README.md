### **Description**

Roger Skyline is not a programming project, but a serie of exercises about the basics of network administration. 
The first part, [Init] (./init.en.pdf), requires you to find the right command to extract various informations. 
The second part, [Roger_Skyline] (./roger_skyline.en.pdf), requires you to build a Virtual Machine and to set up properly protected ssh connection, firewall rules, to test attacks such as DDOS and port scanning, to set up a web server and a SSL certificate, etc. 
The way I built the VM and satisfied all the subject requirements is in the RS1 rtf file that I used as a memo all along the configuration, unfortunately I wrote it in french...
